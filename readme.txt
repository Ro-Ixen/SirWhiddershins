Here's how to use the assets.

- Navigate to "2DSideScrollerBP > Sprites > OurSprites"
- Drag the files into the folder on the bottom.  It should import them as Textures
- For each one, create a Sprite object by right clicking, scrolling down to "Miscellanous > Sprite"
- Rename it to texture name + "Sprite"
- Double Click on the Sprite you created to  open the editor.
- On the right side under the details, change the source texture to the one you want.
- Scroll down and change the "collision thickness" to 100.

After following all of that you should be able to drag and drop the sprites
  onto the Map in Unreal.  If you can't collide with it. Change the collision
  thickness to 250 or click on the sprite, choose the green arrow, and drag it
  towards you.
